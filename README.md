# Computer Vision Soccer Player Detection

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for creating, training, and showcasing a machine learning model based on the YOLOv8 architecture. The notebooks are designed to demonstrate the workflow from training to model evaluation and prediction showcasing.

## Contents

- `CreateModel.ipynb`: This notebook guides you through the process of loading data, loading in the YOLOv8 model architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- `Showcase.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the capabilities of the trained model, allowing you to input a YouTube URL to see the model's predictions and analyze its performance.

## YOLOv8 Model

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. YOLOv8 is the latest version in the YOLO model architecture, known for its speed and accuracy.

## Training Data
To train the model, download the training dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iasadpanwhar/football-player-detection-yolov8). The dataset is not included in this repository. Once downloaded, place the dataset in the appropriate directory as specified in CreateModel.ipynb.
